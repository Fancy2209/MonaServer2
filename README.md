# MonaServer

*Temporary project planned to replace [MonaServer](https://github.com/MonaSolutions/MonaServer).*

MonaServer is a lightweight web and media server customizable by [LUA](https://www.lua.org/) script applications.
MonaServer supports currently following protocols:
- HTTP(TLS) with a rendez-vous extension (cmd *RDV*) to meet peers together (e.g. SDP exchange for WebRTC)
- WebSocket(TLS)
- STUN
- RTMP(E)
- RTMFP
- SRT
- RTP, RTSP *(in progress...)*

MonaServer supports advanced features for the following media containers:
- MP4
- FLV, F4V
- TS
- HLS
- ADTS, AAC, MP3
- SubRip, VTT
- Mona

Start MonaServer developments by [reading the documentation](#Documentation)

## Unix setup

### Requirements
- [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version >=5 (or compliant clang...)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) libraries with headers, usually dev-package named `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`
- [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) library with headers, dev-package named libluajit-5.1-dev or prefer luajit 2.1 beta by building from sources:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT.git
cd LuaJIT
make && sudo make install
```

- To enable [SRT Protocol] install [SRT]

### Build
[Download] or [clone] MonaServer sources and compile everything simply with make:
```
git clone https://github.com/MonaSolutions/MonaServer2.git
cd MonaServer2
make
```
To enable [SRT Protocol] define *ENABLE_SRT* variable
```
make ENABLE_SRT=1
```

### Start
Start executable file *./MonaServer/MonaServer*

## Windows setup

### Binaries
A [Windows 32-bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/monaserver/files/MonaServer/MonaServer_Win32.zip/download) and a [ Windows 64-bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/monaserver/files/MonaServer/MonaServer_Win64.zip/download) zipped packages are provided to test MonaServer. However we recommend to build the github version from the sources for production use.

### Requirements
- [C++ vc_redist.x86 Visual Studio 2015 package](https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202015&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads)
- To enable [SRT Protocol] download and build [SRT], put the header files in *External/include* and the libraries in *External/lib* and *External/lib64* (with a *d* sufix for the debug librairies):
```
MonaServer/External/lib>dir                 MonaServer/External/lib>dir
    srt/srt.h                                   pthread_lib.lib
    srt/logging_api.h                           pthread_libd.lib
    srt/platform_sys.h                          srt_static.lib
    srt/srt4udt.h                               srt_staticd.lib
    srt/version.h
    win/syslog_defs.h
```

***Note:*** [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) and [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) dependencies are already included in the project.

### Build
[Download] or [clone] MonaServer sources, open *Mona.sln* project file with Visual Studio, right clic on *MonaServer* project and clic on *Build*.

### Start
Start MonaServer by selecting *MonaServer* project and pressing *F5*.

## macOS setup

### Requirements
- [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) version >=8 and Xcode dev Tools which you can install using the following command :
```
xcode-select --install
```
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) libraries with headers. The most simple way to install them is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_it):

First, install homebrew :
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Then install openssl :
```
brew install openssl
```
- [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) library with headers :
```
brew install luajit
```
Or prefer luajit 2.1 beta by building from sources :
```
git clone https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT.git
cd LuaJIT
make MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 && sudo make install
```
***Note:*** Mac-OSX target require a MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET definition with *make MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.X* where (10.X is your macOS version), see [this LuaJIT issue](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/484) for more details.

- To enable [SRT Protocol] install [SRT] :
```
brew install srt
```

### Build & Start
See [Unix setup](#Unix-setup) Build and Start chapters

## MonaTiny
MonaTiny is a version of MonaServer without LUA script applications.
Setup is identical excepting that there is no LuaJIT dependency, just start executable file *./MonaTiny/MonaTiny*
